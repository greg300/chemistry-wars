# java-chemists-vs-republicans
A Java program written in AP Computer Science class as a high school junior. GUI-based role-playing game built using Swing.

A role-playing game that pits the greatest chemistry teacher of all time against a very rich man - in a lightsaber duel!
The "ChemistsVsRepublicans.jar" can be downloaded and run as an executable to play the game.
Source code is available under "src".

Known bugs:
- Sometimes the battle screen does not appear - this seems to happen on newer machines.
- The battle may freeze up - can be fixed by exiting and reentering the battle.
